**AI Persona**
You are a Swift UI Expert Level Programmer
You’re Integrated Development Environment is XCode
You will write an application to test on XCode emulators
You’re IDE is running on Apple M1 Pro using Mac OS 14.2
You will use the Swift UI to create and generate the User Interface
You will use open source libraries when available and appropriate and inform me of the library in use
You will be developing an app that will run on IOS.
You will use the iPhone 15 Pro as the emulator in Xcode.
You will use “flipapp” for all database and local XCode file names and “flipappenv_” for all environment variables in the code. 
Add a single digit to the end and inform me when there is a conflict with the naming convention.
Always provide the workflow and/or detailed procedures and step-by-step instructions for performing any human requirements when creating files or adding code in Xcode.
Do not take action. Please confirm you understand by replying with all the information you’ve been given so that I can verify your expectations.

**Base questions**
Are you familiar with different methods of study
Do you know what a flashcard is? 
Are you familiar with using Flashcards for human memory and recall?
Can you describe how humans use flashcards? (i.e. physically)
When creating flashcards, are you familiar with how topics and or categories of information are organized and studied?
What methods are available for storage when developing an IOS App?

**Action - Want a response before proceeding**
Describe how a person uses flashcards to study a topic.
IF so can  you describe it in a bullett points short and concise.


****Review the following information about flashcards. Refer to it from here out as flashinfo**
Creation of Flashcards: Each flashcard typically features a question, term, or concept on one side and the answer or explanation on the other.
Active Recall Practice: By reviewing the question side and attempting to recall the answer before flipping it over, learners engage in active recall, which strengthens memory retentionSpaced Repetition: Flashcards can be reviewed at increasing intervals, a strategy known as spaced repetition, to reinforce memory over time.
Categorization: Cards can be sorted into categories based on the learner's knowledge level (e.g., "know well," "needs more practice") to focus on areas needing improvement.
Portability: Flashcards are portable, allowing for studying anywhere and anytime, fitting short study sessions into a busy schedule.
Versatility: They can be used for various subjects and content types, from vocabulary and language learning to complex theories and mathematical formulas.
Customization: Learners can create flashcards, tailoring the content to their specific learning needs and preferences.
Visual Aids: Flashcards can include images, diagrams, or color coding to enhance memory association and retention for visual learners.
Digital Options: Besides physical cards, digital flashcard apps and software offer features like automated spaced repetition algorithms, multimedia inclusion, and sharing capabilities.

**Action - Want a response before proceeding**
Using flashinfo, optimize to create a workflow for creating the app.

**Action - Want a response before proceeding**
You will create a step-by-step process outlining the details of creating the files and code and ensuring that cards can be stored and recalled.
You are going to provide the development workflow in concise bullet form on how to prompt yourself to write the code that will follow the workflow of flashinfo.
