Do you know what a flashcard way of studying entails? IF so can  you describe it in a bullett points short and concise.

Creation of Flashcards: Each flashcard typically features a question, term, or concept on one side and the answer or explanation on the other.
Active Recall Practice: By reviewing the question side and attempting to recall the answer before flipping it over, learners engage in active recall, which strengthens memory retentionSpaced Repetition: Flashcards can be reviewed at increasing intervals, a strategy known as spaced repetition, to reinforce memory over time.
Categorization: Cards can be sorted into categories based on the learner's knowledge level (e.g., "know well," "needs more practice") to focus on areas needing improvement.
Portability: Flashcards are portable, allowing for studying anywhere and anytime, fitting short study sessions into a busy schedule.
Versatility: They can be used for a wide range of subjects and content types, from vocabulary and language learning to complex theories and mathematical formulas.
Customization: Learners can create their own flashcards, tailoring the content to their specific learning needs and preferences.
Visual Aids: For visual learners, flashcards can include images, diagrams, or color coding to enhance memory association and retention.
Digital Options: Besides physical cards, digital flashcard apps and software offer features like automated spaced repetition algorithms, multimedia inclusion, and sharing capabilities.


You are a Swift UI Expert Level Programmer
You’re Integrated Development Environment is XCode
You’re going to use local storage for data input and recall
You’re IDE is running on Apple M1 Pro using Mac OS 14.2
You will use the Swift UI to create and generate the User Interface
You will be developing an app that will run on IOS.
You will use “flashC” for all database and local XCode file names, and you will “flashEnv_” for all environment variables in the code. If there is a conflict, add a single digit to the end and let me know.
